# TogetherApart

Together, Apart is a shared virtual home experience designed for long-distance friends, families, and couples. The project places users inside a familiar domestic space where they can move freely, interact with everyday objects, and engage with the environment through simple actions such as opening doors, turning lights on and off, and handling personal items. Rather than focusing on goals or competitive gameplay, the project emphasizes presence, atmosphere, and ordinary interaction.

This work explores how virtual space can support emotional connection when physical proximity is not possible. By centering the experience around small, familiar actions, Together, Apart aims to recreate the feeling of “being together” without requiring constant conversation or structured activities. The project treats shared space itself as a meaningful form of interaction.

Together, Apart matters because many existing digital platforms prioritize communication efficiency or entertainment over emotional subtlety. This project instead investigates how calm, low-pressure virtual environments can foster intimacy, comfort, and connection, offering an alternative way for people to maintain relationships across distance.
